# Space Salvage Empire - New Player Guide

Welcome to **Space Salvage Empire**! You are the commander of a remnant fleet, tasked with rebuilding humanity's hope—the **Exodus Ark**—after a cataclysmic event.

This guide will walk you through the basics of survival, resource management, and the journey to the stars.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Your First Run

Your first run is about survival and learning the ropes. It will likely take a few days of real-time play to complete, but don't worry—future runs will be much faster!

### Phase 1: The Scavenger (LEO Orbit)
1.  **Manual Labor**: Click to collect **Debris**. You need this to build your first machines.
2.  **First Automation**: As soon as you have 10 Debris, buy a **Salvage Drone**. These collect debris automatically.
3.  **Scale Up**: Aim for 10 Salvage Drones. This unlocks the **Refinery Barge**.
4.  **Refinement**: Buy a Refinery Barge (75 Debris) to start converting Debris into **Metal**. Metal is the backbone of your fleet.

### Phase 2: Reaching Out (GEO Orbit)
*   **Goal**: Reach **GEO (Geosynchronous Orbit)**.
*   **Requirement**: 100 Fuel.
*   **How**: You can't produce fuel yet! You must scavenge it from **Derelicts**.
*   **Steps**:
    1.  Unlock **Scout Probes** (requires GEO access, but you can see them early).
    2.  Build a Scout Probe and send it to find derelicts.
    3.  When you find a derelict (like a "Cargo Container"), use a **Salvage Frigate** (once unlocked) or just your base fleet capabilities if available to salvage it.
    4.  Look for fuel rewards. Once you have 100 Fuel, use the **Travel** button to move to GEO.

### Phase 3: The Economy Grows
In GEO, you gain access to **Electronics**.
*   **Electronics Extractors**: Build these to generate Electronics passively.
*   **Tech Tree**: You can now start collecting **Data Fragments** from derelicts. Use these to buy upgrades in the Tech Tree (Efficiency branch is great for starters!).

## 💎 Resources & Economy

Mastering the flow of resources is key to victory.

| Resource | Logic | Primary Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Debris** | Raw material. | Salvage Drones, Clicking. |
| **Metal** | Consumed for ships/fuel. | Refinery Barges (Converts Debris). |
| **Electronics** | Advanced tech components. | Electronics Extractors, Derelicts. |
| **Fuel** | Required for travel & missions. | **Fuel Synthesizers** (Mars Orbit+), Derelicts. |
| **Rare Materials** | For high-tier ships. | **Matter Extractors** (Jovian+), Rare Derelicts. |
| **Data Fragments (DF)** | Research currency. | Derelicts, Anomalies. |

> [!TIP]
> **Bottleneck Alert**: Early on, you might run out of Debris if your Refineries work too fast. Upgrade your Drones or buy more Drones to keep up!

## 🛸 Fleet Management

Your ships are divided into two categories:

### Production Ships (Passive)
These generate resources automatically over time.
*   **Salvage Drone**: +Debris
*   **Refinery Barge**: Debris → Metal
*   **Electronics Extractor**: +Electronics
*   **Fuel Synthesizer**: Metal → Fuel (Unlocks at Mars)

### Active Ships (Missions)
These are used for active gameplay.
*   **Scout Probe**: Finds derelicts. more probes = higher discovery chance.
*   **Salvage Frigate**: Harvests derelicts.
*   **Colony Ship**: One-time use to boost an orbit's production by 25%.

> [!NOTE]
> Ship costs increase exponentially (mostly). Buying in bulk (Buy 10, Buy Max) is often efficient but watch your reserves!

## 🛰️ Missions & Derelicts

The **Derelict System** is your primary source of loot and specific resources you can't produce yet.

### The Loop
1.  **Scout**: Send Probes to find a derelict.
2.  **Evaluate**: Click the derelict card to see rewards and risks.
    *   **Common**: Safe, low rewards.
    *   **Uncommon/Rare**: Better loot, but might cost more fuel.
    *   **Legendary**: Contains **Ark Components** (Endgame).
3.  **Action**:
    *   **SALVAGE**: Standard safety. 100% rewards.
    *   **HACK**: Risky! Costs Electronics but gives **150% rewards** + Data Fragments. Use this if you have high success chance.
    *   **DISMANTLE**: Very slow (3x time), expensive (2x fuel), but gives **200% rewards**!

## 🔬 Tech Tree & Progression

Spend **Data Fragments** in the Tech Lab.

*   **Efficiency Branch**: improved production rates. **Priority for early game.**
*   **Exploration Branch**: Faster missions, better scouts. Good for mid-game.
*   **Economy Branch**: Quality of Life (Auto-clickers, Bulk Buy buttons).

### 🌌 Prestige (Dark Matter)
At some point, progress will slow down massively. This is when you **Prestige** (Quantum Reset).
*   **You Lose**: Ships, Resources, Current Techs.
*   **You Keep**: **Dark Matter (DM)**, Achievements, Premium Perks.
*   **Dark Matter**: Used to buy permanent perks like "Start with 10 Drones", "Keep Techs", or "Skip LEO Orbit".

**The 10-Run Goal**: The game is designed to be beaten in ~10 runs. Each run you will get further, faster, until you can assemble the Ark.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for New Commanders

1.  **Offline Progress**: Your fleet works while you are away (up to 4 hours by default). Come back to massive resource piles!
2.  **Don't Hoard Data Fragments**: Spend them! Technologies reset on prestige, so use them to push further in your current run.
3.  **Dark Matter is King**: If a run feels stuck, it might be time to reset. The DM you earn will make the next run fly by.
4.  **Watch Fuel**: Getting stuck without fuel in a high orbit is bad. Always keep a reserve for basic missions or travel back.

Good luck, Commander. The fleet awaits your orders!
