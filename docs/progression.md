---

### **Run 10: The Final Assembly** (8-10 days)
**Active:** 12-15 hours | **Idle:** ~180 hours

This run is structured in phases:

#### **Phase 1: Preparation (Days 1-2)**
- Build up massive production infrastructure
- Accumulate 1,000,000+ fuel for Deep Space expeditions
- Quantum Miners building exotic alloy reserves

#### **Phase 2: Deep Space Expeditions (Days 3-5)**
- **Deep Space Zone mechanics:**
  - Fuel cost: 100,000 per trip
  - Travel time: 6 hours real-time
  - Derelict spawn rate: 1% of normal rates
  - 8th Ark component (Navigation Array) has 0.5% drop from legendary derelicts
- Make 8-12 Deep Space runs
- RNG hunt for final component
- **Find 8th Ark component!**

#### **Phase 3: Resource Gathering (Days 6-7)**
- Ark Assembly requires MASSIVE resources per component:
  
```
Each of 8 components needs assembly:

Propulsion Core:
- 10M metal, 500K exotic alloys, 50K fuel, 1K AI cores
- Construction time: 24 hours

Life Support Grid:
- 5M metal, 200K electronics, 50K rare materials
- Construction time: 18 hours

Navigation Array:
- 8M metal, 300K electronics, 100K data fragments
- Construction time: 20 hours

... (8 total, each with similar requirements)
```

Even with massive production, gathering these resources takes time.

#### **Phase 4: Assembly (Days 8-10)**
- Start construction on each component
- **Real-time construction timers** (can't be skipped)
- Components build in parallel (if you have resources queued)
- Watch the Ark slowly come together visually
- Each component completion triggers celebration animation

#### **Phase 5: Launch Sequence (Day 10+)**
- All 8 components assembled
- Final "Launch Ark" button appears
- Confirmation: "Launch the Exodus Ark and complete humanity's mission?"
- **VICTORY SCREEN**
  - Total time played
  - Total resources gathered
  - Derelicts salvaged
  - Completion stats
- Credits roll
- Unlock: **Endless Mode** or **New Game+ Challenges**

## The Difficulty Curve

```
Difficulty/Challenge Level:

Run 1:  ████████ HARD (learning, slow, resource-starved)
Run 2:  ███████ (still challenging, getting tools)
Run 3:  ██████ (smoother, new capabilities)
Run 4:  █████ (comfortable, efficient)
Run 5:  ████ (getting easier, power fantasy)
Run 6:  ███ (fast, optimized)
Run 7:  ███ (fast, focused)
Run 8:  ███ (fast, strategic farming)
Run 9:  ████ (preparation for finale)
Run 10: █████████ EPIC (massive scale, RNG hunt, assembly grind)
```

---

## Total Timeline

**Calendar time:** 43-51 days (6-7 weeks)
**Active play:** 65-80 hours total
**Idle time:** ~900+ hours
**Play pattern:** 1-3 sessions per day, 30min-2hr each

---

## Does This Feel Complete?

We now have:
✅ 10 distinct runs with clear progression
✅ Every run unlocks something new
✅ Run 1 is a week-long challenge
✅ Runs 6-9 stabilize at 2 days each
✅ Run 10 is 8-10 days (as long or longer than Run 1)
✅ Combination approach (Deep Space hunt + Assembly grind)
✅ Numbers scale exponentially (1x → 10,000x production)
✅ Clear victory condition (Ark complete)

**Next step:** Should we start building this, or do you want to refine any other systems first (derelict types, tech tree details, specific ship abilities, etc.)?
